# Day 1 – React Counter (useState Fundamentals)

## What I built
A counter application using React and Vite.

## Concepts practiced
- useState hook
- Functional state updates
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Handling edge cases in state updates
- Understanding React’s batching behavior

## Key learnings
- Normal variables don’t trigger re-renders; React tracks state changes
- React batches state updates for performance
- Functional updates (`prev => prev + 1`) prevent stale state bugs
- Clean naming conventions and separation of logic from JSX matter

## Next
Breaking this into reusable components and passing data using props.
